/* Force field recovery behavior
 * 
 * Original idea from : https://github.com/daenny
 * 
 * Main code idea mostly taken from : 
 * 
 * https://github.com/smARTLab-liv/smartlabatwork-release/blob/master/slaw_registration/src/forcefield_recovery.cpp
 * 
 * Refactored, enhaced and mantained by: 	Oscar Lima (olima_84@yahoo.com)
 * 
 * About this code: Plugin for the mobile base (move_base ros) : Recovery behavior
 * that moves away from obstacles by using the costmap. It calculates the vector resultant
 * in a pointcloud of obstacles and moves away from the cluster by publishing on cmd_vel topic
